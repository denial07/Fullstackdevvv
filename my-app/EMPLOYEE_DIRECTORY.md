# Employee Directory System Documentation

## Overview

The Employee Directory System is a role-based web application that allows Managers and Administrators to view, search, filter, and export employee information. The system integrates with MongoDB and provides PDF export functionality.

## Features

### üîê Role-Based Access Control
- **Administrators**: Can view all employees across all departments
- **Managers**: Can only view employees within their own department
- **Employees**: Have no access to the directory

### üîç Search & Filter Capabilities

- **Combined Filters**: Use multiple filters simultaneously

### üìÑ PDF Export
- **Role-Specific Exports**: 
  - Admins can export all employees
  - Managers can only export their department's employees
- **Filtered Exports**: Export respects current search/filter criteria
- **Professional Format**: Includes company branding, filters applied, timestamps, and user info

### üìä Pagination & Sorting

- **Sorting**: Sort by various columns (name, department, join date, etc.)
- **Performance**: Optimized queries for large datasets

- Pagination to handle large datasets
- Optimized queries with field selection

### Frontend
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Lazy loading with pagination
- Efficient state management

### API
- Response caching where appropriate
- Compressed JSON responses
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes

## Error Handling

### Client-Side
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states during API calls
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Server-Side
- Comprehensive error logging
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error responses for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Access Denied" Error**
   - Check user role in database
   - Ensure JWT token is valid
   - Verify department assignments

2. **PDF Export Fails**
   - Check jsPDF installation
   - Verify server memory for large exports
   - Check browser popup blockers

3. **No Employees Showing**
   - Run seed script: `npm run seed:employees`
   - Check database connection
   - Verify user department matches employee departments

4. **Search Not Working**
   - Check MongoDB indexes
   - Verify search query encoding
   - Test API endpoints directly

### Logs & Debugging
